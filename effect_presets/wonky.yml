  comment: Swing a 16th note triplets. A more laidback swing that the regular one. But it cuts against the regular beat divisions, which might sound strange in some songs.

  comment: This adds a very light swing. It divides beats into 7 and removes the last. This breaks regular beat divisions, so it has a jerky sound.
